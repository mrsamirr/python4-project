Here is a Instruction covering the chat application code with a server and client:

# Simple Python Chat Application

This project consists of a simple chat server and client written in Python that allow multiple clients to connect and chat with each other.

## Files

**chat_server.py**

This contains the server code. It creates a listening socket, accepts connections from multiple clients, and broadcasts messages from each client to all other connected clients.

**chat_client.py** 

This contains the client code. It connects to the server, takes user input and sends messages to the server, and displays messages received from the server.

## Usage

1. Run chat_server.py first to start the server:

```
python chat_server.py
```

2. Take note of the host and port it is listening on. Default is 127.0.0.1 port 12345.

3. Next run chat_client.py in multiple terminals to create multiple clients: 

```  
python chat_client.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to enter a username for each client. 

5. Any message typed by a client will be broadcasted to all other connected clients.

## Implementation

The server uses Python's socket module to create a TCP socket. The socket listens for connections from clients and spawns a new thread whenever a client connects. 

The thread handles all communication for that particular client only. It receives messages from the client and broadcasts the message to all other clients by looping through the list of connected sockets.

The client simply connects to the server socket, takes user input to send messages, and prints any messages received from the server.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- socket module

## Limitations

- Basic functionality only, no error checking.
- No encryption/security.
- Client has to be restarted if server goes down.

Some ways to improve and build on top of this:

- Add ability to handle client disconnects without crashing.
- Add 1 on 1 chat functionality in addition to broadcast.
- Add authentication and encryption for security. 
- Improve UI of client with separate threads, notifications etc.

Overall this provides a simple foundation for building a networked chat application in Python.
