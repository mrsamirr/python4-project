## Features

- Creates subdirectories for each file type.
- Moves files to their corresponding subdirectories in the target directory.
- User-friendly, with interactive input for source and target directories.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `file_organizer.py` script is located.

3. Run the script by executing the following command: `file_organizer.py`

4. Follow the prompts to provide the source directory and target directory paths.

5. The script will organize the files in the source directory and move them to the target directory.
