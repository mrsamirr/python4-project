# Web Scraping Project 

## Overview

This project is a web scraping script that extracts data from a website and saves it in a structured format, such as CSV or JSON. The example script provided here is for educational purposes and is designed to scrape quotes from a sample website. You can use this script as a starting point and customize it to scrape data from your target website.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the script, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

```
## Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open the provided web scraping script (web_scraping.py) in a text editor or Python IDE.

Modify the script according to your needs:

Update the url variable with the URL of the website you want to scrape.
Adjust the HTML element selectors and data extraction logic to match the structure of the target website.
Save the script.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

Run the script using the Python interpreter:

```bash
python web_scraping.py
```
If the script successfully scrapes data, you will see a message indicating that the data has been saved to a CSV (or JSON) file.

You can find the scraped data in a file named quotes.csv (or your specified filename) for CSV or quotes.json for JSON in the same directory as your script.
